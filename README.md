SICP - Exercises & Examples
===========================

My takes on the infamous **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (2nd edition)** book by **Sussman&amp;Abelson**.

It contains code for both the **examples** and the **exercises**.

I used the MIT-Scheme interpreter for checking.

Some solutions for the exercises are inspired or copied from [the Scheme community](http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions).

Some of the answers for particular exercises are missing (the ones I found no fun in doing it or I considered not being very practical).
